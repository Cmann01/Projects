## Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting mental fitness based on various factors. It involves data cleaning, visualization, and two different regression models - Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression. The project is implemented in Python using libraries such as pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook or a Python IDE
- Required Python libraries (can be installed using pip):
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn
  - plotly

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python environment.

3. Open the main project notebook.

## Data Preparation

The project involves working with two datasets, performing data cleaning, and merging the datasets. Here are the steps involved in data preparation:

- Loading data from CSV files.
- Handling missing values.
- Renaming columns for clarity.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The project includes various data visualization techniques to understand the relationships between different features and the target variable. The following visualizations are created:

- Correlation heatmap to visualize feature relationships.
- Pair plots for feature distribution.
- Pie chart to display mental fitness distribution over the years.
- Line chart to visualize mental fitness trends over time for different countries.

## Modeling

Two regression models are implemented in the project:

1. **Linear Regression**: A simple linear regression model is used to predict mental fitness based on various features. The model's performance is evaluated on both the training and testing data.

2. **Random Forest Regression**: A more complex Random Forest Regression model is implemented to predict mental fitness. The performance of this model is also evaluated on training and testing data.

## Model Evaluation

Both models are evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score. These metrics help assess how well the models perform in predicting mental fitness.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project provides an analysis of mental fitness data and predictive models for mental fitness based on various factors. The Random Forest Regression model demonstrates higher accuracy in predicting mental fitness compared to the Linear Regression model.
